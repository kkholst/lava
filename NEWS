* Version 1.2.1 <2013-05-10 Fri>
  - Optimization + minor bug fixes

* Version 1.2.0 <2013-03-28 Thu>
  - New method 'iid' for extracting i.i.d. decomposition (influence
    functions) from model objects (e.g. glm, lvm, ...)
  - Method 'estimate' can now be used on model objects to transform
    parameters (Delta method) or conduct Wald tests. Average effects,
    i.e. averaging functionals over the empirical distribution is also
    possible including calculation of standard errors.
  - 'curereg' function for estimating mixtures of binary data.
  - Instrumental Variable (IV) estimator (two-stage
    least-squares) optimized.
  - New distributions: Gamma.lvm, coxWeibull.lvm, coxExponential.lvm,
    coxGompertz.lvm. New method 'eventTime' (for simulation of
    competing risks data)
